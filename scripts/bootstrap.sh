# bootstrap.sh — gets the agent alive, then gets out of the way.
#
# This script does FOUR things: Homebrew, Node + Git, Claude Code, and the
# handoff. Everything else about setting up Freedom — VS Code, the capture
# stack, the GitHub login, your workspace, the plugin, hourly sync, the
# launcher — is done afterwards by the agent, following the install skill it
# fetches at the end.
#
# Why the split is here and not further along:
#
#   Every step that runs BEFORE the agent exists is a step with no recovery.
#   A script has to predict its failures; an agent can read one it has never
#   seen, on a machine nobody tested, and ask you a question instead of dying.
#   The old version of this file ran thirteen steps before handing off, and
#   its own escape hatch was "paste the last twenty lines into your AI chat"
#   — which is the agent doing recovery anyway, just by hand, after the
#   failure, for someone who does not know what they are looking at.
#
#   So the boundary is drawn at the earliest point where an agent can exist.
#   You cannot agent your way to having an agent: something has to install
#   Node and the harness. That part is irreducible, and it is all that is
#   left here.
#
# Idempotent: every step checks before it acts. Running it twice is harmless;
# running it on a half-set-up machine finishes the job.
#
# It orchestrates only official installers (Homebrew's install script and
# Homebrew-reviewed casks). It fetches no binaries itself.
#
# Usage:
#   bash bootstrap.sh                  # the normal path
#   bash bootstrap.sh --dry-run        # print what would happen, change nothing
#   bash bootstrap.sh --no-launch      # stop before the handoff
#   bash bootstrap.sh --print-handoff  # show the handoff command and exit
#

# The install skill the agent follows once it is alive. Hosted rather than
# shipped, for the same reason the upgrade ledger is hosted: an operator who
# ran an old bootstrap still gets the CURRENT install steps, and the skill can
# be fixed without cutting a template release. It is public and needs no auth,
# which is what keeps the private-repo GitHub login on the agent's side of the
# boundary instead of dragging it back into this script.
